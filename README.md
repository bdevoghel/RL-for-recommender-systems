# Deep Reinforcement Learning Approaches for Recommender Systems
> Project realized for the Advanced Deep Learning course at PoliMi

Implementation of the different approaches to the recommender problem with reinforcement learning (RL).


This project uses the VirtualTaobao gym envrionment tu run the RL framework. More on that in its [subdirectory](./VirtualTaobao/).
